196,196,Nutrition Consultant (MMS),"To provide technical support to MOH and sub-national level demonstration of MMS. Under the general supervision of the Nutrition officer and the nutrition manager, she/he will provide technical support at different implementation levels on the demonstration of MMS in selected 21 woredas in [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Sidama, Somali, and [REDACTED] regions. Background The introduction of multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) as part of maternal nutrition programming is an opportunity to accelerate progress toward several Global Nutrition Targets. Recent global evidence has concluded that antenatal MMS is superior to iron and folic acid supplementation. Studies show that MMS containing 15 vitamins and minerals is a low-cost, high-impact solution that can improve maternal nutrient intakes during pregnancy to meet increased demand for multiple micronutrients, reduce maternal anemia and improve birth outcomes, including reduction of low birth weight, SGA, and prematurity. Based on the existing body of global evidence on the MMS, the WHO released recommendations for countries to consider the inclusion of the MMS as part of their ANC service package and scale-up based on local research context. With support from the CIFF UK, [REDACTED] is supporting the MoH and the Regional Health Bureau to roll out MMS among pregnant women in [REDACTED]. This initiative involves a demonstration program on the MMS for the period of 2021-2025 in 21 [REDACTED] woredas, aiming at generating optimal demand for MMS, improving the delivery of recommended maternal nutrition services through ANC, and strengthening systems as well an enabling environment (supply chain, information, regulatory and local production). The TA will mainly be working with MOH nutrition and maternal health teams focusing on the demonstration of Multiple Micronutrients for PW in 21 selected woredas selected in five regions ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], Sidama, Somali and [REDACTED] regions). The TA is expected to have considerable experience in designing and implementing maternal nutrition programs as well as experience working with the Ministry of Health (MoH) at national and subnational levels. Justification [REDACTED] provides technical, advocacy, and financial support to the government’s National Food and Nutrition strategy to influence policies, strengthen the delivery of nutrition services, promote positive behaviors and eventually, improve the nutritional status of children, adolescents, and women. Among the key programs supported under the National Food and Nutrition strategy is Maternal Nutrition which is the critical component of curbing the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition. Therefore, the Ministry of Health has requested [REDACTED] for TA support which will support day-to-day activities on the demonstration of MMS in 21 woredas. The activity is also a new initiative for MOH and the RHBs needs full-time engagement and support. [REDACTED] ECO nutrition section intends to recruit a consultant for 24 months as support to MoH. The nutrition consultant will mainly be working with the MOH and RHBs Nutrition team and [REDACTED] nutrition team focusing on the demonstration process of MMS at national, regional, and in the selected implementation woredas. 1. Key functions, accountabilities, and related duties/tasks Under the primary supervision of MOH Nutrition and secondarily Nutrition officer (MN) and [REDACTED] Nutrition (CBN/MN) Manager Nutrition Manager in [REDACTED], the consultant will be responsible for the following specific tasks. Program planning and implementation A micronutrient deficiency prevention and control (MDPC) technical working group has been established by MoH to support new initiatives such as Multiple Micronutrient Supplementation (MMS) for pregnant women.

337,337,Videographer and Editor,"[REDACTED] is a growing non-profit social enterprise that builds scalable solutions, using mobile technologies, to deliver resources to underserved communities where traditional aid fails to address the changing needs of fragile markets.Our digital platform, Tiko, connects users to health facilities and local small businesses—giving them both the power to access health information and wellbeing services on their own terms. [REDACTED] has primarily been supporting young women’s access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services and products through it’s motivation platform and ecosystem (Tiko). [REDACTED] is our second largest ecosystem and is in need of stock imagery to support the activities that we will be relaunching on the ground. In the market we currently run two programs, firstly that of sexual and reproductive health and secondly of access to job skills trainings The Tiko platform: Our membership platform, Tiko, connects members to a range of health and wellbeing offers for them to explore on their own terms. It is accessible to anyone with a mobile device through social media platforms, SMS,Whatsapp or Telegram or membership cards if one hasn’t access to a device. [REDACTED] is also a motivational platform that encourages its members to adopt positive behaviours using periodic behavioural “nudges” driving them to make good choices. For example, people fail to follow through on many types of important intentions; in order to address and attempt to close the intention-action gap regarding a health service, Tiko platform would send a personalised “planning prompt” to a user due for a clinic appointment soon. We close this motivation loop with rewards which we call “Tiko Miles” , a reward which acts as a digital currency that users redeem at a local shop or kiosk for essential goods. As they maintain their behaviour, the rewards continue to accumulate. Think of Vitality points ,but for the bottom of the consumer pyramid.

457,457,Business Analyst & Test Lead - Mastercard Inclusive Identity Project,"CTG overview: CTG staff and support humanitarian projects in fragile and conflict-affected countries around the world, providing a rapid and cost-effective service for development and humanitarian missions. With past performance in 17 countries – from [REDACTED], Africa, Europe, and Asia, we have placed more than 20,000 staff all over the world since operations began in 2006. CTG recruits, deploys and manages the right people with the right skills to implement humanitarian and development projects, from cleaners to obstetricians, and mechanics to infection specialists, we’re skilled in emergency response to crises such as the Ebola outbreak in [REDACTED]. Key to successful project delivery is the ability to mobilise at speed; CTG can source and deploy anyone, anywhere, in less than 2 weeks and have done so in 48 hours on a number of occasions. Through our efficient and agile HR, logistical and operational services, CTG saves multilateral organisations time and money. We handle all our clients’ HR related issues, so they are free to focus on their core services. Visit www.ctg.org to find out more Overview of position: Our client is a global organization dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights building a better future for refugees, forcibly displaced communities stateless people. Every year, millions of men, women children are forced to flee their homes to escape conflict persecution. Our clients need for software information system support continues to grow, as does the need to continuously improve expand information communications systems infrastructure across the organization. Through the pilot project our client in [REDACTED] is seeking to test a particular biometric authentication during distribution processes using [REDACTED]'s Inclusive Identity (IID) technology. The pilot project in [REDACTED], in partnership with [REDACTED], intends to test a biometric authentication modality during distribution processes using [REDACTED]'s IID. [REDACTED]’s IID solution enables the population of concern to our client (in the frame of this pilot specifically refugees) to verify their identity to confirm receipt of their entitlements with their biometrics, by showing the authenticating party their face along with their identity credential (in the frame of this pilot specifically their smart card identity document) containing pre captured, tokenized, digital biometric reference data for offline matching on a smartphone or tablet operated by our client / partner staff. Our clients existing solutions authenticate biometrically against non tokenized biometric data held on a server (locally or over the internet) rather than authenticating against tokenized biometric data held on a credential owned by the refugee. The matching process under [REDACTED]’s IID technology works on commercially available mobile devices (smartphones, tablets), including the Android smartphones already available in the operation in [REDACTED], which is currently using them for the Global Distribution Tool (GDT). To prevent abuse of or unauthorized access to the biometric reference data embedded in refugee identity documents, prior saving, [REDACTED]’s IID application will use a one way data transformation function to convert the biometric template to an irreversible identity token, which then will be digitally signed. The pilot project has the following objectives: Authentication using biometric features (i.e. face) in online offline environments running on commercially available non proprietary smartphones or tablets, whenever needed for integrity checks during service delivery processes (i.e., upon entry to the distribution site at each distribution point), without access to data exchange required with a central data base. As part of quality control, add a layer of verification enabling refugees to acknowledge with their biometrics receipt of assistance to validate relevant transactions. Strengthen integrity accountability in the distribution process without compromising the protection of sensitive personal information which may otherwise happen through sharing unencrypted data with government entities of the [REDACTED] (govt.) involved in the distribution process. Empower refugees to be able to demonstrate anywhere that our client / RRS issued smart cards belong to the rightful individual (smart card holder) following a successful 1:1 biometric verification against identity token(s) stored within our client / RRS issued identity document. Provide learnings on potential future developments of our clients digital identification systems, including using new approaches to mainstream end user research as part of development roll out potentially testing piloting human rights due diligence approaches.
